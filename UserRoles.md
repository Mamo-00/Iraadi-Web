## <p style="text-align: center;">User Roles</p>

- ### **Admin** 
    - Create categories and subcategories \*not priority\*
    - approve/reject listings (or maybe just the listings that are flagged)
    - change or add website policies and guidelines \*not priority\*
    - be able to set up user roles and permission 

<br/>  

- ### **Moderator**
    - flag and clean up bad listings
    - ban bad users
    - handle disputes between buyer and seller
    - answer questions from users \*not priority\*

<br />

*\*could merge the two roles together if necessery (will be the easiest :))*

<br />

- ### **Seller**
   - List their ads
   - Edit their listing \*not priority\*
   - let them have the ability to remove their ads

<br />

- ### **Buyer**
   - Be able to favorite ads
   - Search for specific items (consider whether they can  
     do that only inside a category or straight from the homepage)  
   - Messaging tool for contacting seller (for now, they do it  
     through calling/messaging their phone number but will implement it later)
       

*\*could add a built-in payment system if we are confident in implementing it*
